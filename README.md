This is the brain of [Caenorhabditis elegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans), ported to Javascript. *C. Elegans* is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system, with a brain containing only 302 neurons. As of 2012, the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal "wiring diagram") completed.

Be warned that by running this, you may be simulating a living being depending on how you think about it... best not to think about it too much

Based on the python <a href="https://github.com/Connectome/GoPiGo">GoPiGo Connectome</a> by Timothy Busbice, Gabriel Garrett, Geoffrey Churchill

You can see the brain placed in a little virtual worm body <a href="http://zrispo.co/worm/">here</a>
